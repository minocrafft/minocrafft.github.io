I like lists because they are:

- fun
+ easy, and
* fast.

Lists can also be ordered:

1. First element
2. Second element
  - with an unordered sublist

And you can add tables:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| I        | like     | tables   |
| This     | is       | content  |
